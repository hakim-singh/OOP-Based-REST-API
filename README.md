🚀 Built a Complete Core PHP OOP-Based REST API
 🛠️ No frameworks, no PDO — just pure PHP + MySQLi and JWT 🔐
Over the weekend, I created a full-featured REST API using Core PHP with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The goal: demonstrate secure API design without relying on Laravel or any frameworks.
✅ Key Features:
🔐 JWT Authentication (Login & Registration)
🧱 Middleware-style Token Protection
📦 CRUD Operations for Posts
💡 Clean OOP Structure Using MySQLi
